# Spectre API Setup Notes

## Learnings

- Gained experience in setting up a development environment for both Java and C applications.
- Learned about compiling C code and building Java applications using Gradle.

## Challenges

- Configuring the environment to handle both Java and C components was initially complex.
- Ensuring all dependencies for the build process were correctly installed and configured.

## Additional Remarks

- Future iterations could explore containerization of the API for easier setup and scalability.
- Monitoring and logging could be integrated for better management of the API in a production environment.
